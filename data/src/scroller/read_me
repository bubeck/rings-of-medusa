Dear Translator,

There were some misunderstandings, so I try to explain some things again.

It's very *IMPORTANT* that your translation is not longer than the desired 
length. These lengths are written behind each line. Look also at the beginning 
of the files for more information.

There is no more room for longer translation, so your translation *COULD* not 
be longer than desired, otherwise *I* had to shorten it. My abbreviation will 
always be more bad than yours. This is why some of the strings of the spain 
version are wrong, because I had to shorten them. So look for the right 
length.

One more thing: The translator of the spain version said, that I swapped the 
'y' with the 'n'. I'm not sure, whether this is in the whole game or only in 
the scroller. But I think he means only the scroller. I admit that 'y' and 'n' 
look similiar, but there *are* differences between them. So look again 
carefully at the scroller, then you'll recognize the difference.


                                Sincerely 
                                
                                      Till Bubeck
