   You have succeeded.... After having banned the evil goddess
 Medusa you have no problems in destroying the crystal Dohor. As
 the crystal was the sole source of Medusa's might, you have once
 again saved the kingdom of Morenor with Medusa's power
 crumbling, the force field that held you and her in the future
 dissolves. Thoroughly exhausted you return from your journey to
 the future. Now nothing stands between you and your coronation.
 But what happened to Medusa? .... Is she truly dead or was she
 only injured?..... Will she return yet again to wrest Morenor
 from you?....
 You shall find the answer to this and many other questions in
 the Rings of Medusa III, the ultimate revenge of Medusa.
